## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **VSCode**: Install Visual Studio Code for editing the project files.
- **Cypress**: This project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing.

## Setup Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
   cd <your-project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Open Cypress**:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   You can run the tests either through the Cypress UI or by using the command line:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

## Writing the Script

The automation script is structured following the Page Object Model. Key functionalities covered include:

- **Search for existing products**.
- **Search for non-existing products**.
- **Submit empty search**.
- **Search for criteria resulting in multiple products**.

### Key Files

- `cypress/integration/search.spec.js`: Contains the test cases.
- `cypress/pages/SearchPage.js`: Implements the Page Object Model for search functionalities.
- `cypress/fixtures/testData.json`: Contains test data for search operations.

## Running the Tests

To run the automated tests, use the Cypress Test Runner or the command line as mentioned above. The results of the tests will be displayed in the Cypress dashboard.
