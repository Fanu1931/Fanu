# Employee Management and String Manipulation

This repository contains a Java program that implements a class hierarchy for employees and a function to remove duplicate characters from a string.

## Overview

The program demonstrates polymorphism through an abstract class `Employee` and its subclasses: `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Intern`. Each subclass overrides the `work()` method to describe its specific responsibilities.

Additionally, the program includes a function that removes duplicate characters from a given string while preserving the original order of characters.

## Class Hierarchy

1. **Employee (Abstract Class)**
   - Fields: `name`, `salary`
   - Method: `abstract void work()`

2. **Manager (Subclass of Employee)**
   - Overrides `work()` to output: "Manager [name] is managing the project."

3. **Developer (Subclass of Employee)**
   - Overrides `work()` to output: "Developer [name] is coding the application."

4. **Intern (Subclass of Employee)**
   - Overrides `work()` to output: "Intern [name] is learning and assisting the team."

## Removing Duplicate Characters

The function `removeDuplicates(String input)` takes a string as input and returns a new string with duplicate characters removed, preserving the order of their first appearance.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmployeeManagement.git
   cd EmployeeManagement
  

2. Compile the Java files:
   
   javac Main.java
   

3. Run the program:
   
   java Main
   

4. Follow the prompts to enter a string and view the output for both employee tasks and duplicate character removal.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

## Testing

The program has been tested with various inputs to ensure correctness:

- Employee list includes:
  - Manager: John
  - Developer: Alice
  - Intern: Bob

- Test string inputs for duplicate removal, e.g., "Hello, World!"

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code as needed!
